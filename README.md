# Smart Library System

## Overview
The Smart Library System is a microservices-based application designed to manage users, books, and loans in a library environment. Each service operates independently, allowing for scalability and maintainability.

## Architecture
The system is composed of three main microservices:
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts and profiles.
- **Book Service**: Handles book inventory and related operations.
- **Loan Service**: Manages the loaning and returning of books.

## Services

  - `GET /users/:id`: Retrieve user details
  - `PUT /users/:id`: Update user information

### Book Service
- **Description**: Manages the library's book inventory, including adding, updating, and searching for books.
- **Endpoints**:
